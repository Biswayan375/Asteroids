# Asteroids
A cheap clone of asteroids

This cannot be called a clone of Asteroids as it don't have any scoring system or the player's ship cannot get hit by the asteroids either.
It only has the core ship controls, bullet firing, arbitrary asteroid shape and nearly pixel-perfect collision detection(without using any
third party library). But I intend to add quadtree to be able to fire multiple bullets and doing collision detection and resolution without
having to face any frame rate drop issue. This is built using p5.js library and I am in love with its community. While coding the game, I went
to the libraries section of p5 website where I found a library for collision detection with the github link. The author of that library left
the link of a great reference for all kinds of collision detection techniques. It contained the basics of collision detection. I went to use
that library but I didn't. I coded that collision detection between points and polygons. The world is full of this kind of good people!
